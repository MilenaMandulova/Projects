## About

Hi, my name is Milena Mandulova and I'm a graduate of business administration from Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. Currently, I'm working as an Analitycs Engineering Intern at Vestiaire Collective in Berlin, Germany. Here, I've been fortunate to gain practical insights into data cleanup, transformation, and deployment processes. My passion for data transformation and analysis began during my academic years, where I delved into lectures on statistics, econometrics, business intelligence, and market research. Eager to learn, I've been taking online courses on [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com) since November 2022, focusing on Data Analyst and Data Scientist tracks. So far, I have taken courses in SQL and Python, and I have completed two career tracks: "Data Analyst in SQL" and "Data Analyst with Python". In addition, I've taken courses from [dbt Labs](https://courses.getdbt.com/) - "dbt Fundamentals", "dbt Cloud and Snowflake for Developers", "Analyses and Seeds", "Webhooks", and "Jinja, Macros, Packages".

<br>
The aim of this repository is to showcase the skills I have as well as some of the tasks from the DataCamp courses.
