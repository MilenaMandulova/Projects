## About

Hi, my name is Milena Mandulova and I'm a graduate of business administration from Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. I finished my bachelor degree at the end of January 2023 and would like to pursue a career in data analytics. During my studies I attended lectures in statistics, econometrics, business intelligence and market research. Additionally, since November 2022, I have been taking online courses on the [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com) platform for Data Analysts and Data Scientists. So far, I have taken courses in SQL and Python, and I have completed two career tracks: "Data Analyst in SQL" and "Data Analyst with Python". 

<br>
The aim of this repository is to showcase the skills I have as well as some of the tasks from the DataCamp courses.
